## Usage
    Mixed-Bg-Fg-Synthesis
            ├──────────── C-GLO
            └──────────── Detection


1.Clone the Mixed-Bg-Fg-Synthesis repository:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/ivclab/Mixed-Bg-Fg-Synthesis.git


2.Follow the instruction in [C-GLO](https://github.com/ivclab/Mixed-Bg-Fg-Synthesis/tree/master/C-GLO) and get the augmented training data.
  

3.Use the augmented data generated from C-GLO and train on Stingray [Detection](https://github.com/ivclab/Mixed-Bg-Fg-Synthesis/tree/master/Detection).
